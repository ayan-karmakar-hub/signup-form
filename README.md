/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a sign-up form that I modeled after
Mint.com's, which can be found here:

https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html?offering_id=Intuit.ifs.mint&namespace_id=50000026&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmint.intuit.com%2Foverview.event%3Ftask%3DS

This project was purely aesthetic in nature, so no functionality
was added to the form.

/******** Relevant Files *********/

index.html: Basic html code including all relevant form elements.

styles.css: The css file that contains all styling done to the HTML.
